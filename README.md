# Eclipse Tractus-X Architecture Special Interest Group

## Overview

This is the Special Interest Group for Architecture (sig-architecture) within the Eclipse Tractus-X project. Our primary aim is to document the overall architecture from Tractus-X. Also this repository is a place were Tractus-X Architects can align and document the different design decisions that affect the Tractus-X Product as a whole. 

## Objectives

- Define architecture guidelines for Tractus-X Products
- Document the architecture and how all the products come together as a whole
- Document the design decisions of the project itself, regarding other dataspaces and organizations.
- Document the relationships in between products, aligning and keep things running in between the dependencies
- Enable a fluid and synchronized integration of the Tractus-X Dataspace, having a big picture how it comes together.
- Easy the understanding for external technical viewers who want to learn how Tractus-X has been built from architectural point of view.

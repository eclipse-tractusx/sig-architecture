# Decision Record: Adding Tractus-X IdentityHub and Tractus-X IssuerService

## Problem statement

The current Tractus-X architecture is dependent on a proprietary credential service ("wallet") for both managing and issuing verifiable credentials.
This renders it impossible to run a Catena-X dataspace using only open-source software.
To remove this dependency, we need both a new open-source credential service and an issuer service that does not rely on proprietary software.
Both must implement the [Decentralized Claims Protocol](https://eclipse-dataspace-dcp.github.io/decentralized-claims-protocol/), which Catena-X has committed to.

## Evaluation criteria

Possible approaches are evaluated based on a set of requirements the issuer service should fulfil.

### Functional

The issuer service should support the following features without delegation to or reliance on external, proprietary services:

- credential creation
- VC signing
- VC revocation
- DID management
- key management
- implement the DCP protocol

### Non-functional

#### Reusability across Manufacturing-X

To enable interoperability with other dataspaces, the issuer service must not be specific to the Catena-X dataspace, but at the very least be reusable across Manufacturing-X.

#### Support for credential services independent of where they are hosted

Credential services in future releases may be hosted by various parties (e.g. operating company, ESP, dataspace member).
Therefor, the issuer service must not rely on the credential service being hosted by any specific entity.

#### Be open for extension

The Tractus-X architecture must be able to support potential new protocols and new credential types in the future without requiring extensive refactoring of the existing code base.

## Possible approaches

Theoretically, it would be possible to continue development of the `ssi-credential-issuer` component until all of the aforementioned drawbacks are addressed.
However, doing so would amount to an almost complete rewrite of the application due to significant architectural differences, while additionally suffering from the following drawbacks:

- duplicate all development and testing efforts around DCP that are _already implemented upstream,_ specifically:
  - JSON-LD algorithms (Note that this has nothing to do with the proof type of credentials, JSON-LD is simply required by the DCP endpoints.)
  - cryptographic utilities, keys, signatures
  - all model classes, support for VC DataModel 1.1 _and_ 2.0
  - credential status list services
  - a generic credential generation framework
- devise, implement and test a complete extensibility framework
- implement, test, and maintain an admin API to be consumed by portal

Given the development and maintenance efforts that would be necessary, refactoring the `ssi-credential-issuer` is not a viable alternative.

## Proposed decision

Add two new repositories (related PRs [tractusx-identityhub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn/pull/117) and [tractusx-issuerservice](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn/pull/118)) for Tractus-X distributions of the [Eclipse EDC IdentityHub and IssuerService](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub):

## Decision

A Tractus-X distribution of the [Eclipse EDC IdentityHub](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub) is introduced as an open-source decentralised credential service for the Tractus-X architecture.
A Tractus-X distribution fo the [Eclipse EDC Issuer Service](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub) replaces the current [ssi-credential-issuer](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-credential-issuer) as the implementation of the Tractus-X issuer.

### Rationale
[//]: # (Why is this decision taken)

- continuing development on the [ssi-credential-issuer](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-credential-issuer) until all requirements listed above are met involves an amount of work essentially equivalent to a rewrite from scratch 
- introducing Tractus-X distributions of upstream dataspace-agnostic projects is essential for interoperability with other dataspaces
- using components from upstream projects as standard dependencies in Tractus-X distributions reduces development, testing, and maintenance effort within Tractus-X

### Actions
[//]: # (What direct next steps should be taken because of this decision?)

Add two new repositories (related PRs [tractusx-identityhub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn/pull/117) and [tractusx-issuerservice](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/.eclipsefdn/pull/118)) for Tractus-X distributions of the [Eclipse EDC IdentityHub and IssuerService](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/IdentityHub):

- `tractusx-identityhub`
- `tractusx-issuerservice`

Use the relevant components from upstream developments as standard dependencies in the Tractus-X distributions.

Responsible committers for the new repositories as of now are Boris Rizov (@borisrizov-zf) and Rafael Magalh√£es (@rafaelmag110).

### Implications
[//]: # (What happens as a direct consequence of this decision?)

From release 25.09 onwards, the current [ssi-credential-issuer](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-credential-issuer) will no longer be needed in the Catena-X architecture and will therefore no longer need to be maintained.
